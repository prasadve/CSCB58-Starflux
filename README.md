# CSCB58-Starflux
Scrolling-Shooter built using Quartus and the HDL Verilog, which was made for the Altera DE2-115 board. The player controls a lone space
ship, and they must shoot any enemies that come into view along its current path. However, the enemies can also fight back, so the player
must also dodge any incoming missiles launched by the enemy spaceships. The ship's gun has unlimited ammo, but can get too hot and needs
time to cool down. The player continues to fight until its health bar has been copmletely depleted or the player reaches the maximum
possible amount of points they can obtain. Both instances cause the game to end, but the player can restart the game, even while they are
still playing.
