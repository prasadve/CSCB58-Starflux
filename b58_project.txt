Project Details
---------------
Project Title:

Starflux

Project Description:

Vertical version of the arcade game: FPGA defenders. The difference being
is that we have a cool down timer, a health bar, and allows for movement
in all directions(up, down, left, right).

serve as a useful resource for future development):

Proposal
--------

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:

We plan to have the basic functions of the game completed by the end of the first
lab session. That includes the basic movements of the ship and its bullets, as
well as the cool down timer and the score. We would have also made plans
for the graphics of the game.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:

We plan to have completed the functions of the enemy ships and also their
movements. We will also add other features such as the health bar, and refine
the feature of the score with the max score cap. We would also have begun the
graphics of the game being displayed to the screen.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:

By the end of the third session, we plan to have completed the game mechanics. We also
would have refined the final graphics of the game and make sure all the functions of the
game have been met.

What is your backup plan if things don’t work out as planned?

If things go off course, we are willing to work extra hours or remove some features
of the game, such as the health bar or the cool down timer. We can also tone down
certain features, such as having enemy ships continue down one column down the
screen instead of giving them dodging capabilities.

What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board
(be sure to e-mail Brian if it’s anything beyond the basics to make sure there’s enough to go around)

None so far.

Motivations
-----------
How does this project relate to the material covered in CSCB58?:

This project relates to the material covered in CSCB58 with the use of
shift registers and counters from the labs. It is also an application of the VGA
display. And given enough time, we could also impelement some sort of strategy
for the enemey ships by making use of FSMS.

Why is this project interesting/cool (for CSCB58 students, and for non CSCB58 students?):

This project is interesting for people because many people take great enjoyment
in video games, and Starflux will be a game that can start off many who are new
to gaming.

Why did you personally choose this project?:

We chose this project because we felt it would be a nice challenge to see how
well we can apply our learned concepts into something fun that can also be built upon
later on. One of the members of the group remember the game being implemented
by one of their friends in highschool (with Java), and saw a lot of the core
components could be translated over to hardare.

Updates
-------

Week 1: We built the cooldown timer and also tested the bullets. Unfortunately, the bullets were completely non-functional
despite best efforts, so we will work extra hours to fix the issue, as there is no game without the weapon. However, the cool
down timer and score are working, just need to speed up the clock and add a narrower cap to prevent the player from waiting so
long for their gun to cool down. Of course, we will have to at this point double book to make time for the next lab session. We
have also changed features to make the gun and bullet mechanics easier, such as simpler bullet mechanics for the enemy ships that
will also act as a series of boss fights rather than a swarm.
